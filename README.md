# An-application-of-graph-optimization-to-automatic-image-processing

Program built in Python and it's libraries: OpenCV, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tryalgo. It uses image gradient for edges detection and max-flow min-cut
theorem and Edmonds-Karp algorithm for image segmentation. At the input, the user marks the object to be cut and its background with the mouse. On the output we get our marked object on a white background.
